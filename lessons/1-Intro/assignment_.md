# Dota 2 and OpenAI

I am a huge fan of Dota 2, and I've been playing for years. For a long time, the game had a "Play versus the Computer" bot that was terrible at the game—predictable, slow, and easy to beat.  

That all changed when OpenAI created a new bot for a Dota 2 event. This bot **destroyed every player** it faced with unhuman reflexes and innovative strategies, using the map and items in ways no human would think of.  

Over several years, OpenAI developed a **team of these bots** capable of playing together against human teams. This innovation changed the way players approached the game: analyzing the bots’ strategies taught humans new tactics and ways to think about Dota 2.  

Even though the bots didn’t win every match, they made **clutch plays** and seemed to anticipate human moves with uncanny precision. This project is a perfect example of AI in action—learning, adapting, and collaborating in a complex, dynamic environment. It shows how AI can not only compete with humans but also inspire humans to evolve their strategies.
